# Football-Analysis-IP

This is an analysis and predictions of football matches using the world fifa rankings dataset as of 2018 and the different games played.

## Description
This project contains 3 predictive models created using python and it's libraries to:

i.) Predict how many goals the home team scores.

ii.) Predict how many goals the away team scores.

iii.)  Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)

## Usage
Depending on the home team, away team and their respective rankings on fifa, the models can predict the scores of various teams.

## Support

# Football Analysis

This is an analysis and predictions of football matches using the world fifa rankings dataset as of 2018 and the different games played.

## Description
There is one notebook for all the models built.

The following models were built: a linear regression model, a polynomial regression model and a logistic regression model to:

i.) Predict how many goals the home team scores.

ii.) Predict how many goals the away team scores.

iii.)  Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)

## Usage
Open the notebook using the Google Colaboratory link provided, copy it on your drive in order to edit and save your changes.

## Installation
Install Python and it's libraries in order to understand this project and use the models.
